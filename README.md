# GESTURE-CONTROLLED-ROBOT-CAR
This is a Radio Frequency transmitted gesture-controlled Robot car that is controlled by a controller placed at hand. The controller is the Transmitter circuit that sends the gestures as signals that are received by the car that moves accordingly. The car is the receiver circuit.
Internet of Things, or IoT, refers to the expansion of the capabilities of physical devices. In
order to enable the items to sense their surroundings with the least amount of human
involvement, they are connected to the Internet. With the use of wireless networks, these
devices gather, distribute, and utilise data to get the desired results. By fusing the digital and
physical worlds, the Internet of Things is making the environment around us smarter and more
responsive. The term "gesture" refers to human hand and face motion. The primary goal of this
project is to control the car using hand gestures. An accelerometer is used to detect human hand
motions. The necessary activities for the human gesture are performed as a result of the coding.
These sensed signals are analysed, and then using an RF transceiver module, they are sent to
the robotic car at the receiving portion. The vehicle therefore makes the necessary movement.
